# Interverntion-based Autoencoder

This is an autoencoder that generates a latent representation that is 
disentangled w.r.t. different interventions on the generation of its 
observations.

# To-Do

+ Hyperparametrization
+ Analysis of results

## Hyperparameterizsation

1. (check) Find a good number of epochs to hyperparameterize & allow in-between prints
2. (check) Model w/o filters (LR, layers)
3. (check) Selection discount w/o minimization
4. (check) Minimization discount w/o selection
5. (check) Try everything together
